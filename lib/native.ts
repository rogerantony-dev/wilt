/**
 * Optional bridge to the platform's own UI toolkit.
 *
 * A handful of controls are better served by the real thing than by a faithful
 * re-implementation: a switch, a picker, a sheet and a button are muscle
 * memory, and users notice when the animation curve or the haptic is a
 * near-miss. Passing `native` to those components hands rendering to SwiftUI
 * on iOS and Jetpack Compose on Android.
 *
 * It is optional on purpose. The package is resolved lazily and every caller
 * falls back to the styled implementation when it is missing, so nobody who
 * never writes `native` has to install anything.
 *
 * ```sh
 * npx expo install @expo/ui
 * ```
 *
 * **Theme tokens do not apply in native mode.** The platform draws the control
 * with its own colours, metrics and typography — that is the entire point, and
 * it means `className` and the variant props are ignored on those components.
 *
 * The one exception is which appearance it draws: `colorScheme` is the single
 * theme signal the toolkit accepts, and `NativeHost` is what passes it. Mount
 * every host through that rather than reaching for `Host` directly, or the
 * control resolves its own appearance from the system and stops tracking the
 * app's theme.
