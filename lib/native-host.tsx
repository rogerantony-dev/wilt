/**
 * The host every native control is mounted in, told which appearance to draw.
 *
 * A hosting controller resolves its colour scheme from the trait environment
 * it is placed in, which is the system appearance — not the theme the app is
 * running. Those are the same thing only by coincidence: an app in a dark
 * theme on a phone set to light gets a light platform control beside dark
 * content, and a theme changed at runtime leaves the control where it was,
 * because nothing in the trait environment moved.
 *
 * So the appearance is passed rather than inferred. `colorScheme` is the one
 * theme signal the platform toolkit accepts, and this is the single place it
 * is given.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const { Host, Switch: NativeSwitch } = nativeUI;
 * <NativeHost host={Host} matchContents ignoreSafeArea="keyboard">
 *   <NativeSwitch value={on} onValueChange={setOn} />
 * </NativeHost>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why the host arrives as a prop
 *
 * There are two of them. The universal `Host` comes from `getNativeUI()` and
 * the SwiftUI-only one from `getSwiftUI()`, and a caller has already resolved
 * whichever it needs before it renders. Taking the component rather than
 * resolving it again keeps this file free of the module bridge, which is what
 * lets the bridge re-export it without the two importing each other.
 *
 * ## Why this is a component rather than a hook at each call site
 *
 * `useThemeMode` subscribes to theme changes, and a hook cannot be called
 * conditionally — so reading it inside `Button` would put a subscription on
 * every button in a list for a branch almost none of them take. Here the
 * subscription exists only where a native host is actually mounted.
