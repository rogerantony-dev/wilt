/**
 * `react-native-keyboard-controller` needs its provider at the root, and
 * forgetting it is a silent failure — the hooks return zeroes and keyboard
 * avoidance simply does nothing. Mount it here when the package is installed
 * so `avoidKeyboard` works without any extra setup, and fall back to a
 * pass-through when it is not.
 *
 * Installed is not the same question as usable, and the difference is what a
 * `try`/`catch` around the `require` cannot see. In a client that loads no
 * native modules of its own — Expo Go — the JavaScript is in `node_modules`
 * and resolves, so the require succeeds and hands back a provider whose native
 * side is absent. The throw then lands when that provider mounts, outside the
 * `try`, and takes the app down before anything has painted.
 *
 * `TurboModuleRegistry.get` answers the real question and returns null rather
 * than throwing, so the pass-through is reached instead.
 *
 * Resolved on the first render rather than when this module is evaluated. This
 * file is the first thing a consuming app imports, and asking the native module
 * registry a question before the runtime has finished standing up is a question
 * asked too early — by the first render it is up, and the answer cannot change
 * afterwards. The result is cached so the component type is stable: swapping it
 * between renders would unmount and rebuild everything below it.
